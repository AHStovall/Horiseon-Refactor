# Code Refactor Starter Code

This document contains a brief description of the code refactor that occured for the landing page of the Horiseon Marketing Firm. 

The main focus of this code refactoring was tailored around clean up of the semantic code, in order to provide additional clarity for engineers and end-users. Providing updated semantics, such updating the <nav>, <main>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, etc. in lieu of the <div> element allows for a better understanding of the overall sections. 

Similarly, the title within the head of the index has been updated to provide with a more concise and clear description of the landing page. 

In the same vein of clarity, the site has improved on it's accessibilty standards, with <alt> tags added to each photo on the page to provide additional insight to the images. Further accessibiltiy will need to be added, with more fluid adjustment necessary to the sizing of the webpage due to the adjustment of broswer and device sizes. 

Please see the relative pathed screenshot below.
